# Book Republic: A Book Exchange System
Authors: Charmaine Matienzo and Prof. Danilo J. Mercado

This study is about the development of a web application that provides
an interface for book enthusiasts to freely trade books over the
internet. The system allows users to perform borrow and swap
functions as well as socialize with other users. Ratings of the
system usability and user experience were examined from 24
participants, each of which is either a student or a professional.
The results suggest that the novelity of book exchanging of the
web application as opposed to the manual counterpart positively
impacted the ratings of system usability.
